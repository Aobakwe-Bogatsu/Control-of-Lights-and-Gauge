# Control-of-Lights-and-Gauge

An interactive visual sketch built using the **Processing** environment.  
This project displays **four horizontally-aligned LEDs** with interactive color changes via mouse clicks, along with a **gauge bar** that increases or decreases in real-time using the arrow keys.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design a user interface in Processing that:
- Shows four LEDs aligned horizontally
- Allows color change of each LED with mouse interactions:
  - Left-click sets the LED to **yellow**
  - Right-click sets it to **purple**
- Updates labels dynamically based on the selected color
- Displays a **gauge bar** directly beneath the LEDs
  - Controlled with **left/right arrow keys**
  - Shows percentage from **0% to 100%**
  - Updates the gauge fill and label in real-time
